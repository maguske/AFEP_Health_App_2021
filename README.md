## Potential of health apps to capture health-enhancing exercise with a focus on muscle and balance training.

Capturing health-enhancing exercise through technology (apps and smartphones, smartwatches, other sensors and gadgets) already works well for many forms of aerobic exercise training.  In the case of anaerobic exercise training (muscle training) and
and the recording of body balance and coordination of movement
challenges with regard to the use of sensor technology, usability and the
sensor technology, usability and acceptance.

These deficits have a negative effect on the motivation to use such apps, which can also be influenced by various motivational techniques (nudging) and appropriately designed training programs. (nudging) and appropriately designed apps with a good user experience (UX) can hardly compensate.
The aim of this work is to investigate the discrepancy between current health recommendations, especially regarding muscle training and balance training, and the current technical possibilities for users.
potentials for further development in this respect and to identify and
and to evaluate them on the basis of a prototype.
